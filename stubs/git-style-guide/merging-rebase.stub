[my-branch] $ git fetch
[my-branch] $ git rebase origin/master

This results in a branch that can be applied directly to the end of the
"master" branch and results in a very simple history.

*(Note: This strategy is better suited for projects with short-running
branches. Otherwise it might be better to occassionally merge the
"master" branch instead of rebasing onto it.)*
